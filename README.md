# FreeSASA FFI

This crate provides raw FFI bindings to the [freesasa](https://freesasa.github.io/doxygen/index.html)
C library, developed by [Simon Mitternacht](https://github.com/mittinatten) \[1\]. FreeSASA allows
you to calculate the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of a protein from its atomic
coordinates. The library is written in C, and is available under the MIT license.

The bindings in this crate are automatically generated by `bindgen`. Since this crate provides
raw access to a C-library, it is on the user to ensure that memory safety is maintained.
